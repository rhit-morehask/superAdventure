# superAdventure

I had followed this tutorial here https://scottlilly.com/learn-c-by-building-a-simple-rpg-index/ to make a simple RPG. This shows my ability to follow through with directions. Should be noted I had completed the original tutorial, then attempted to make some modifications afterwards.

I'd like to note I had no experience with C# before this tutorial.
